# Raven-Engine

**Game engine for learning and practicing.**

## Introduction

Raven engine is a experimental sandbox for me to learn various game development techniques, reinforce my programming ability and improve my system design capability.

I am a ready-to-graduate college student and still have a lot of interested things to learn. I had wrote some ugly game engines in the past and i think i should learn more from other peoples' projects, instead of pondering on my own and learn nothing. However, I don't mean I throw away my own thinking and attempts completely. We should try thinking by ourselves first and learn the pros and cons from other people who had great experience in game development.

### Why Rust?

Though I work on cpp game development, I choose to write this little game engine in Rust. I think learning and writing Rust can also improve my cpp programming skills especially on multi-threading programming. And i think the codes that i have written in Rust can be translate into cpp, you just need to adjust some designs and make it dialect.

## Road Map

- Mesh Skinning
- Asset Management

### milestone 2

- Self-Writing ECS (Entity Component System)
- Job System
- More Advance Render Features
- Self-Writing Simple Physics Library
- Memory Management
- Platform Abstruction
- Sound

## Acknowledgements

This project is mainly learning from:

* [kajiya](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/kajiya)
* [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)

Above projects are all very fantastic learning material, definitly check those for better documentation.

This repo is just for my clumsy learning purpose.
